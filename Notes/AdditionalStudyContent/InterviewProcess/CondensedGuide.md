*   [Life At Google: How to Prepare for a Technical Interview](https://goo.gle/cs1-enginterviewprep): You might dominate all the technical concepts already, but you’ll need to display that knowledge in a technical interview. Therefore, a good starting point is knowing the structure of a technical interview including best practices for each one of the components of the interview. Having a good understanding of what’s expected in each part of the interview will provide you with much more confidence during the actual interview.

*   Know Your Resume Inside & Out: Anything you put on your resume is fair game for your interviewer to ask.

Articulate the best picture of yourself, your work and be prepared to answer questions on items listed on your resume.
