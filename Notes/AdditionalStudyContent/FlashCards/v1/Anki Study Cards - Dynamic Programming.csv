Top Down Approach,"- The Top Down approach is to solve the problem by solving the subproblems first and then combine the solutions.
    - **Memoization**"
Bottom Up Approach,"- The bottom-up approach is to solve the problem by combining the solutions of the subproblems.    
    - **Tabulation**"
Memoization Overview,"- Memoization is a technique to solve a problem in a way that can be used to solve the same problem in the future.
- Memoization is useful when attacking recursive problems that have many overlapping sub-problems.

- There are two features that compromise memoization:
  - the function is recursive
  - the additional data is stored in a memo object
- Performance
  - Time complexity >**O(n)**
  - Space complexity >**O(n)**"
Memoization Formula O(N),"Implementing memoization
1. Write the unoptimized, brute force recursion and make sure it works.
2. Add the memo object as an additional argument to the function. The keys will represent unique arguments to the function, and their values will represent the results for those arguments.
3. Add a base case condition to the function that returns the stored value if the function's argument is in the memo.
4. Before you return the result of the recursive case, store it in the memo as a value and make the function's argument it's key."
Tabulation Overview,"- Tabulation is a technique to solve a problem in a way that can be used to solve the same problem in the future.
- There are two features that compromise tabulation:
  - the function is not recursive and iterative
  - the additional data is stored in a table (typically a 2D array)

- Performance
  - Time complexity >> **O(n)**
  - Space complexity >> **O(n)**
    - Can be refactored to **O(1)**"
Tabulation Formula O(N),"General guidelines for implementing the tabulation strategy;
1. Create the table array based off of the size of the input, which isn't always straightforward if you have multiple input values
2. Initialize some values in the table that ""answer"" the trivially small subproblem usually by initializing the first entry (or entries) of the table
3. Iterate through the array and fill in remaining entries, using previous entries in the table to perform the current calculation
4. Your final answer is (usually) the last entry in the table"
Fibonacci - Naive approach,"```js
function fib(n) { // O(2^n)
  if (n === 1 || n === 2) return 1;
  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);

Fibonacci - Memoization Approach,"```js
function fastFib(n, memo = {}) { // O(n)
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];

  memo[n] = fastFib(n - 1, memo) + fastFib(n - 2, memo);
