To help you prepare, I have reattached our Software Engineer Interview Prep Guide and have included some tips, tricks, hints, and resources that have been helpful for others in the past. We recommend starting with the tips, then reading the Cracking The Coding Interview textbook and practicing daily using the websites linked below. Much of this information is in the attached prep guide.

To refresh, the first step is a 45-minute phone interview with an engineer who will present coding problems to you via a shared Google doc. You should be hands-free, so I recommend using a headset or bluetooth.**You will NOT be using an IDE or a Compiler**, so I strongly recommend you practice coding in just a Google Doc/whiteboard/paper.

The interviewer will be evaluating your:

\- Coding ability in JavaScript (Let me know if this needs to be changed)

\- Problem solving & communication skills

\- Your knowledge of data structures & algorithms

General Interviewing Tips

*   Google's Interview Prep Guide (Attached)
    
*   Review common CS topics at [Geeks for Geeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
    
*   [Interview Puzzles](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/puzzles/)
    
*   [Practice coding in a Google Doc](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-for-practicing-coding-on-google-docs-for-a-phone-screen)
    
*   Review the Programming Language of your choice. Keep in mind that as you go through your interviews, you will be asked to use the same coding language at all stages of the process.
    
*   [Life At Google: How to Prepare for a Technical Interview](https://goo.gle/cs1-enginterviewprep): You might dominate all the technical concepts already, but you’ll need to display that knowledge in a technical interview. Therefore, a good starting point is knowing the structure of a technical interview including best practices for each one of the components of the interview. Having a good understanding of what’s expected in each part of the interview will provide you with much more confidence during the actual interview.
    
*   [Preparing for a Google Engineering Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko-KkSmp-Lk)
    
*   Know Your Resume Inside & Out: Anything you put on your resume is fair game for your interviewer to ask. In the beginning of the interview you may be asked to speak about a project on your resume. Articulate the best picture of yourself, your work and be prepared to answer questions on items listed on your resume.

My Personal Tips:

*   Continue involving yourself in projects inside and outside of work - whether it's joining coding groups/competitions, creating your own applications or open source projects, we want to see your passion for software development!
    
*   Keep your LinkedIn, Handshake and/or resumé updated with relevant technical information so we can be in loop when it comes to your career development.
    
*   Keep the discussion portion brief and succinct to allow sufficient time to code.
    

*   Be sure to talk through your thought process throughout the interview, nevertheless, keep your verbal explanations short using the appropriate technical terms and leave enough time for coding.
    

*   Keep a confident mindset during the interview. Although during the interview process you may find yourself feeling nervous, scared, or intimidated, remember to take a deep breath, remind yourself of all the practicing you did and that you are capable and confident.
    

Helpful Tips + Tricks

At Google, we believe in collaboration and sharing ideas. Here are a few helpful tips I’d like to share with you to use during the phone interview and onsite interviews:

*   Interview topics may cover anything on your resumé (especially if you have stated you are an expert!)
    
*   Computer Science fundamentals are a prerequisite for all engineering roles at Google, regardless of seniority, and I recommend cracking open the old textbooks and brushing up on things you may not have seen in your day-to-day recently.
    
*   It is OKAY to question your interviewer.
    
*   When asked to provide a solution, first define and frame the problem as you see it.
    
*   If you don’t understand, ask for help or clarification, and talk through the problem out loud.
    
*   Avoid making assumptions. If you do need to assume something, verbally check if your assumption is correct!
    
*   Describe how you want to tackle solving each part of the question.
    
*   Always let your interviewer know what you are thinking. They are just as interested in your thought process as your solution.
    
*   If you talk through your process and are stuck, interviewers may provide helpful hints because they understand your thought process.
    
*   Finally, LISTEN! If your interviewer is trying to give you a hint, don’t miss it!
    

What is Google looking for?

“We are not simply looking for engineers to solve the problems they already know the answers to; we are interested in engineers who can work out the answers to questions they had not come across before.” Therefore, interviewers will be looking at the approach to answering questions as much as the answer:

*   Does the candidate listen carefully and comprehend the question?
    
*   Are the correct questions asked before proceeding?
    
*   Is brute force used to solve a problem? (Try to avoid this when possible!)
    
*   Are things assumed without first checking? (Avoid doing this!)
    
*   Are hints heard and heeded?
    
*   Is the candidate quick to comprehend and solve problems?
    
*   Does the candidate enjoy finding multiple solutions before choosing the best one?
    
*   Are new ideas and methods of tackling a problem sought?
    
*   Is the candidate inventive, flexible, and open to new ideas in their solution?
    
*   Can questioning move up to more complex problem solving?

KNOWLEDGE REVIEW

Knowledge

You should spend time studying and reviewing technical concepts and topics related to Computer Science. The following isn’t a list of topics or readings you must cover but rather a guide and refresher.

COMPUTER SCIENCE TOPICS TO REVIEW

*   Algorithms
    
*   Sorting
    
*   Coding
    
*   Hash Tables
    
*   Trees & Graphs
    
*   Data Structures
    
*   Mathematics
    
*   Recursion
    
*   Operating Systems
    
*   Systems Design  
    

*   Algorithm Complexity: You need to know Big-O. If you struggle with basic big-O complexity analysis, you will struggle in interviews. Run some practice problems, and review the [Big-O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/) !
    
*   Sorting: Know how to sort. Don't do bubble-sort. You should know the details of at least one n\*log(n) sorting algorithm, preferably two (say, quicksort and merge sort). Merge sort can be highly useful in situations where quicksort is impractical, so take a look at it.
    
*   Coding: You should know at least one programming language really well, and it should preferably be C++, Java, Python, C, Objective-C, Swift, Kotlin. The language you feel most comfortable in should be indicated as the language you are interviewing in (which we discussed during our call). Please notify me if this changes or seems incorrect.
    
*   Hashtables: Arguably the single most important data structure known to mankind. You should know how they work. Be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite language, in about the space of one interview.
    
*   Trees: Know about trees, basic tree construction, traversal and manipulation algorithms. Familiarize yourself with binary trees, n-ary trees, and trie-trees. Be familiar with at least one type of balanced binary tree, whether it's a red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree, and know how it's implemented. Understand tree traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder.
    
*   Graphs: Graphs are really important at Google. There are 3 basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list). Familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros + cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms: breadth-first search and depth-first search. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code. If you get a chance, try to study up on fancier algorithms such as Dijkstra and A\*.
    
*   Other data structures: You should study up on as many other data structures and algorithms as possible. You should especially know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems, such as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem, and be able to recognize them when an interviewer asks you them in disguise. Find out what NP-complete means.
    
*   Mathematics: Some interviewers ask basic discrete math questions. This is more prevalent at Google than at other companies because we are surrounded by counting problems, probability problems, and other Discrete Math 101 situations. Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of combinatorics and probability. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk - the more the better.
    

INTERVIEW UP-SKILLING

What you need to know going into the interview:

Please review:

\- [Life at Google: Prepare for Your Google Interview: Coding](https://goo.gle/cs2-codinginterview)

\- [Interview Tips From A Tech Interviewer](https://goo.gle/cs2-interviewtips) by Software Engineer and current Googler, Anthony Mays

\- [How to Impress During a Data Structures & Algorithms Whiteboard Interview](https://goo.gle/cs2-mediumdsa) by Software Engineer and current Googler, Nitesh Donti

\- [Interview tips from Google Software Engineers](https://goo.gle/cs2-sweinterviewtips)

\- The technical interviews involve the following parts and steps:

1.  You will be asked an open-ended question: You will be presented with a problem statement. Feel free to ask for clarifications about the expected solution so you have a clear understanding of what you’re being asked to do.
    
2.  Talk through possible solutions: No need to jump right into coding a solution. Think out loud which possible solutions you can take. You may start with the “brute force” solution — just let the interviewer know that's what you're doing and why. Your interviewer might throw some hints in the form of questions about your solutions. Briefly identify the complexity, advantages, and disadvantages of each solution you come up with.
    
3.  Choose an approach and start coding: Explain your solution as you code each step of the way. You may choose to break your solution into a series of steps and make a function for each one of them. Finally, write the implementation of each function in clean and workable code. Take into account any hints that the interviewer might give you.
    
4.  State any possible optimizations (if any): Think about ways to improve the solution you present. In many cases, your first answer may need some refining and further explanation. If necessary, start with the brute force solution and improve on it.
    
5.  Test your solution: You will be expected to know how to test your code, as well as come up with corner cases and edge cases for code.
    
6.  \*Questions for the interviewer\*: Throughout the interview process, feel free to ask your interviewers for clarification to make sure you fully understand their questions.You will have time to ask questions—about the work, about the team, about the culture—that will help you decide whether the job will be right for you.
    

BEST PRACTICES

Practice, practice, practice!

Once you have the technical knowledge and you know what to expect from a technical interview, you can go ahead and put these concepts into practice. Refer to the resources listed at the beginning of this email as well as the information provided below.

Mock interviews are a must

The [Google Tech Dev Guide](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/) has plenty of sample problems you can tackle. If possible, ask a friend or a mentor to run through some mock interviews with you. Interviewing is a skill that requires having the knowledge, controlling your nerves, explaining your thought process, writing clean and readable code (without an IDE that auto-corrects your syntax or auto-completes your functions), talking about your work, and discussing possible technical solutions.

Online Mock Interview Resources:

There are plenty of online platforms to help you do mock online interviews.

[Leetcode.com](https://goo.gle/cs3-leetcode)

[Interviewcake.com](https://goo.gle/cs3-interviewcake)

[Watch a mock Google interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P67uecluw1s)

You can also find sample coding questions on sites like CodeLab, Quora, and Stack Overflow.

Conduct a Mock interview in a Google Doc:

Your interview process will involve typing your code in a Google Doc (virtual interviews). Be sure to practice so you feel comfortable during your interview
