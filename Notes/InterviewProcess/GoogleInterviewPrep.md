The Large Scale Design Interview

**system design** -
System Design - Questions are used to assess a candidate's ability to combine knowledge,theory, experience and judgement toward solving a real-world engineering problem. In other words, can a candidate "design policies, processes, procedures, methods, tests, and/or components from ground up.


- Sample topics include: features sets, interfaces, class hierarchies, distributed systems,designing a system under certain constraints, simplicity, limitations, robustness and tradeoffs.You should also have an understanding of how the internet actually works and be familiar withthe various pieces (routers, domain name servers, load balancers, firewalls, etc.). Other topics include: traverse a graphs, run-time complexity of graphs, distributed hash table system,
resource estimation with real systems, big product design picture, translation of an abstract
problem to a system, API discussions, binary trees, cache, mapreduce, for loop problems,
index, reverse link-list, compilers, memory cache, networks and also common topics.
Operating Systems - You should understand processes, threads, concurrency issues, locks,
mutexes, semaphores, monitors and how they all work. Understand deadlock, livelock and how
to avoid them. Know what resources a process needs and a thread needs. Understand how
context switching works, how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware.
Know a little about scheduling. We are rapidly moving towards multi-core, so know the
fundamentals of "modern" concurrency constructs.
